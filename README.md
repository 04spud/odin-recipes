# odin-recipes
I am practicing the HTML knowledge that I have acquired from The Odin Project.
I am creating a basic recipe website that consists of an index page with links to a few recipes.

Self-reflection:
I have finished constructing my basic recipe website and feel proud.
I have a better understanding of the Git workflow and the importance of committing messages.
I'm excited to learn the skills that will be taught  to me in the next section (CSS foundations) because it will help me customise the visible elements of my website.

Material learnt in HTML Foundations:
- Difference between Git and Github
- Git Basics
- HTML Elements and Tags
- HTML Boilerplate
- HTML working with Text and Listsß
