# odin-recipes
I am practicing all the HTML knowledge I have acquired from The Odin Project.
I will be creating a basic recipe website that consists of an index page and links to a few recipes.
Recipe 1. Lasagne
Recipe 2. Macaroni and Cheese
Recipe 3. Fruit Salad

Self-reflection
I have finished constructing my basic recipe website and feel proud.
I have a better understanding of the Git workflow and the importance of committing messages.
I am excited to learn the skills taught in the next section (CSS foundations) because it will help me customise the visible elements of my website.

Material learnt in HTML Foundations:
- CLI Basics
- Working with Files and Directories
- Pipes and Filters
- Difference between Git and Github
- Git Basics
- HTML Elements and Tags
- HTML Boilerplate
- HTML working with Text and Lists
