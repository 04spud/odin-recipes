<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. </p>
<p>This fruit salad recipe is bright, colorful, and incredibly delicious.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
