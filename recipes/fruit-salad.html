<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices. </p>
<p>This fruit salad recipe is bright, colorful, and incredibly delicious.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong> fresh orange and lemon juices, brown sugar, grated orange and lemon zests, and vanilla extract </li>
    <li><strong>For the fruit you'll need:</strong> pineapple, strawberries, kiwis, bananas, oranges, grapes, and blueberries</li>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Of course, this is a super customizable recipe â€” you can omit certain fruits or add other fruits to suit your taste and what you have on hand!</p>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
